// much of this brewing info is sourced from Stumptown, Blue Bottle, and La Colombe
// measurements are in grams! 1oz of water  = 29.6g
// ratios are a 1:n ratio of coffee to water.
// ratio usage example: if you want to make a french press of 16oz of coffee you need 16*29.6 / 15 grams of coffee or a 1:15 ratio of coffee to water in grams.
// should guide info be written in MD for rendering?
